Centaurs are a race of humanoid creatures that have half horse and half human features. They stand around 1.8 m tall, and look like a cross between a horse and a man. They're all masculine, regardless of sex. They're masters of all forms of combat, including unarmed combat. They can use weapons as well, but prefer to use their equine abilities as their main weapon.
