Changelings are a race of creatures that take on the appearance of one of the other races, and live amongst them. They have the power to shapeshift, and can even assume the form of a specific person. They're highly mistrusted in demon societies, despite being quite high ranking there. They're regarded as spies and assassins, and are always suspected of being changelings. They're good with magic, and can learn thaumatology like any other demonic race. They're proficient with melee weapons, but will often use stealthy attacks to dispatch their targets. They have no "true" appearance.
